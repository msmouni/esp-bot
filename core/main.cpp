    Name mangling:
        extern "C" makes a function-name in C++ have C linkage (compiler does not mangle the name)
        so that client C code can link to (use) your function using a C compatible header file that contains just the declaration of your function.
        Your function definition is contained in a binary format (that was compiled by your C++ compiler)
        that the client C linker will then link to using the C name.

        Since C++ has overloading of function names and C does not, the C++ compiler cannot just use the function name as a unique id to link to,
        so it mangles the name by adding information about the arguments.
        A C compiler does not need to mangle the name since you can not overload function names in C.
        When you state that a function has extern "C" linkage in C++,
        the C++ compiler does not add argument/parameter type information to the name used for linkage.
